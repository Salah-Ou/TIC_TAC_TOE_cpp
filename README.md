# Tic Tac Toe Game - README

## üìå Overview
This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++ with colorful UI elements and real-time clock display. The game supports two players taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid.

## üöÄ Features
- **Colorful Interface**: Uses ANSI color codes for an enhanced visual experience
- **Real-time Clock**: Displays current date and time at the top of the screen
- **Player Identification**: Clearly shows which player's turn it is with color coding
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid moves and occupied space selections
- **Win/Tie Detection**: Automatically detects game outcomes
- **Replay Option**: Allows players to start a new game after completion

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play
1. Enter player names when prompted
2. Players take turns entering numbers (1-9) corresponding to board positions:
   ```
    1 | 2 | 3
   -----------
    4 | 5 | 6
   -----------
    7 | 8 | 9
   ```
3. Player 1 uses 'x' (green) and Player 2 uses 'o' (red)
4. First player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
5. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie
